# Welcome!
This is a repository for the BT2101 team project for academic year 2024/2025, Semester 2.

Unlike most other iterations, this particular one requires a ground-up initiative with regards to artificial intelligence use. That means we have to do a survey from the start, instead of using exisiting datasets.

# What can you do?
This is mainly where our group parks our code, so anyone can retrive it and do the needful analyses.

# Can you copy this repository and pass it of as my own?
**NO!** This is plagiarism! You CAN be charged with this academic offence, and you CAN face severe penalties.

**In short, don't do it!!!**

# Can I contribute?
**No.**

# Can I get in touch with the owners?
Sure, go find the list of contributors. Thank you.
